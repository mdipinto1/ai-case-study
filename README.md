# Toyota's Toyota Research Institute

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company
  
Toyota Research Institute (TRI)

* When was the company incorporated?
  
TRI was founded by Toyota in 2015 with a mission statement to "to improve the quality of human life through advances in artificial intelligence, automated driving, robotics, and materials science." [^1]

* Who are the founders of the company?
  
Toyota Motor Corporation founded the company, however the Chief Scientest and Founding CEO at TRI is Dr. Gill Pratt [^2]
* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
  
In a news article published a few months before TRI officially began operations (Jan 2016), Toyota Motor Corporation stated the following: "Toyota believes artificial intelligence has significant potential to support future industrial technologies and the creation of an entirely new industry." [^3]
* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
  
TRI received an initial investment of $1 Billion from 2015-2020 from Toyota to start operations. [^3] There were no references of additional funding beyond the initial $1B at this time. 

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
  
TRI does not have a specific problem that the company is targeting. Their vision statement, seen below, is oriented around enabling Toyota products to dramatically improve quality of life for individuals and society. In addition to their vision, their mission statement focuses on accomplishing that goal through research in materials, AI, machine learning, and robotics [^7]

> 
> TRI envisions a future where Toyota products, enabled by TRI technology, dramatically improve quality of life for individuals and society.

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
  
TRI directly supports future development and discovery to support Toyota Motor Corporation. As explained by Jim Adler in a 2018 inerview with AI Today Podcast, An important caveat to their development is that it is not entirely automotive focused, as Toyota believes in remaining diverse and pivoting as required to continue to provide value to consumers.[^5] Toyota Motor Corp's annual Revenue is consistently over $250 Billion [^6]
* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
  
Jim Adler further explained in his interview with AI Today that the most important companies of the future are software centric. In order to remain relevant and dominant within the industry, they need to develop as a software and AI company that makes vehicles. The unfair advantage they bring to the market is a fully developed vehicle manufacturing capability to integrate their developments into, he referred to this head start as a "tremendous mote around the business". [^5] 
* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)]
  
Because their research is so broad reaching, they use numerous technologies depending on the application. Dr. Joseph Montoya is a staff research scientist in the TRI Energy & Materials division. His work specifically has focused in increasing efficiency and longevity in hydrogen fuel cells, one application of ML in his research was drawing inferences for complex alloys from their component elements, beyond what would be available in convential literature and phase diagrams [^4]. It can also be inferred the specific tools they are working with include Pytorch, OpenCV, etc. from reading qualifications on their careers page. [^8]

## Landscape

* What field is the company in?
  
TRI directly supports the automotive industry, however their research is intended to provide resources throughout daily life. This ranges from companion robots that remind humans to take medications to more efficient energy solutions that reduce carbon emissions. [^4][^5]
* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?
  
With respect to the automotive industry, there are countless areas and trends. However, a few key trends are the following: Increased Safety for occupants and pedestrians, increased efficiency, reducing cost through predictive maintenance, and autonomous driving. [^9]
* What are the other major companies in this field?
  
The top 5 companies within the sector (in quantity of vehicles sold) are Toyota, Volkswagen, Hyundai Kia, Stellantis, and General Motors. There are at least 15 manufacturers globally that sell over 1 million vehicles annually. [^11] Additionally, and more relevant to the context of this case study, each of these companies has dedicated Research and Innovation divisions, many of which expand beyond just automotive applications. 

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
  
It's extremely difficult to quantify a numerical impact of a R&D division or subsidiary, however a few articles can help reflect the significance of the research being conducted. 

An article posted by MIT News stated the following: 
>The paper’s most significant practical finding — that these variations in reaction rate are correlated with differences in the thickness of the carbon coating on the surface of the particles — could lead to improvements in the efficiency of charging and discharging such batteries. [10]

As the prevalence of Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO) batteries increases, an increase in battery efficency directly correlates to lower envionmental impacts per unit.

In a totally separate line of effort, TRI demonstrated generative AI for optimizing vehicle aerodynamics. This capability could vastly reduce the number of hours required to optomize a vehicle's design. [^12] What makes TRI's form of generative AI unique is the ability to incorporate design constraints that govern engineering principals and safety practices.
* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?
  
Toyota is the top automotive manufacturer in terms of vehicles sold annually. Furthermore, when considering gross profit, it is in the top 3 manufacturers. Lastly, within the US Market, it recently overtook General Motors, being the first company to out-sell GM _since 1931_. [^13]


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
  
With the increasing maturity of generative AI, I would recommend a customization service at the time of ordering for a vehicle that would allow customers to design a custom paint-job. This would be reasonably achieveable with the increase in automation in automotive production (i.e. painting robots). The 'customer story' in this case would be that a customer can open an AI driven tool (derived from the aerodynamics generative AI tool mentioned above) and customize the paint of their vehicle. At first this could just be custom mixing for individualized colors, and could ultimately lead to customized striping, designs, and even images. 
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

Customization is a huge sub-industry, generating $8 Billion annually. A significant portion of these sales are spent on exterior modifications including full-body wraps. [^14] The cost of a wrap can be up to $10,000 at a professional shop. Offering custom paint from the factory, performed semi-autonomously could offer aesthetic benefits to customers and financial benefits to Toyota.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

From start to finish, this process would utilize generative AI, graphics design software, Computer Vision, and various robotic steps (paint mixing, priming, painting, inspection).

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
